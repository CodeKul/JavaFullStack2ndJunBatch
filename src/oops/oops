- object oriented programming
- Simula is first oop language
- if the programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known
  as truly object-oriented programming language
- smalltalk is first truly oop language
- Java,C#,PHP,Python

Object:
	- real world entity
	- eg Pen,Laptop,Mobile,Chair,Table,Clock,watch

Explain OOP concept?
1. Object
	- real world entity
	- instance of a class
	- has state/property & behaviour, it can be logical or physical
	- consumes space/memory
	- Cat
		state : color,name,breed
		behaviour : running,eating,meow
	  Car
	    state : color,model,name,wheel,gearNo,speed
	    behaviour : run
	  Mobile
	    state : model,color,name
	    behaviour : calling,ringing,messaging,take pic

2. Class
	- collection of objects
	- logical entity
	- a blueprint
	- does not consume any space
	- contains fields,methods,constructors,blocks,nested classes & interface
	- Syntax :
		class class_name{
			fields;
			methods;
			constructors;
			blocks;
		}

3. Inheritance
	- when an object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object
	- provides code re-usability
	- used to achieve run polymorphism

4. Polymorphism
	- one task is performed in different ways
	- a cat sounds meow,lion sounds roar & dog sounds woof

5. Abstraction
	- hiding internal details & showing functionality
	- eg. washing machine, don't know internal processing

6. Encapsulation
	- binding or wrapping code & data together into a single unit
	- eg Capsule, wrapped with different medicines

Explain PIE?
- Polymorphism,Inheritance,Encapsulation
